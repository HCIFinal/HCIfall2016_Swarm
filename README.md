Dining Center Visualization is currently available for NDSU Campus.    

Follow the easy to use visualization as a means of observing traffic flow in 
the NDSU Dining Services. You have the ability of navigating to a certain time,
pausing a certain time, or even speed up how the data flows thorought an interval.
Please enjoy this open source visualization we have provided.

The src files should be self explanatory in the manner of well named classes,
and simple easy to use processing subclasses. Please download our code, download
the open source free softwar Processing from https://processing.org/download/. 
Once those are downloaded, open the src in processing, then run or create 
an executable of our project and run that. Let us know if you have any questions.

P.S. 
A compiled executable file is available here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3-Bf7C0KBf8SDZ6Y1hDWlhnS2M
